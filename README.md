# Sales & Profitability Analysis (Work in Progress)

**Dataset:** This analysis utilizes the [Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final) from Kaggle, which provides comprehensive data on sales, profits, and customer segments.

This repository contains an ongoing data analysis project focused on understanding sales performance and profitability drivers. The analysis is performed using Python and Pandas on a retail dataset.


## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to identify which product categories, customer segments, and regional markets contribute most to the company's bottom line, as well as to evaluate the impact of discounting strategies.


## Current Progress

### 1. Product & Category Profitability (In progress)

### 2. Customer Segments & Regional Analysis (Planned)
Investigating how sales and profits are distributed across different customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home office) and geographical regions.
- Customer segment percentages
- Identifying the most profitable countries.

### 3. Discount Impact Analysis (Planned)
Evaluating whether discounting strategies increase or decrease profit
- Effect of discount on product volume and profit
